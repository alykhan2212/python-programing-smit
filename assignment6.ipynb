    "A Class is a description of a group of objects with common properties (attributes), behavior (operations), relationships, and semantics. A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",

    "<b>Object :</b>\n",
    "Object is an instance of a particular class or subclass. An object is self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.\n",

    "<b>Behavior :</b>\n",
    "A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them."
